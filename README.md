This is my 60% mechanical keyboard with 4 macrokeys. I designed this because I was having trouble getting used to my split keyboard, just because I didnt have the keys I was used to. This keyboard should make most tasks at my computer much easier and more efficient, as I am much faster at typing on a more standard layout than a split. (MORE COMING SOON)
