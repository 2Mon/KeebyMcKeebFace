# Layout Design
I started off this project by designing the layout. Its basically a 60% layout with 4 extra macro keys on the side, ideal for cad shortcuts or other random macros. It also has a rotary encoder (not pictured) for volume or other various tasks. I used keyboard-layout-editor.com to designt the layout, working mostly off the basic 60% layout but adding my own twist.

In this image you can see the general layout. The macro keys are spaced out a bit to allow some breathing room, as I feel that if its closer together it will feel too cluttered. At the top of the macro row is a spot to put the rotary encoder. Ideally I want to be able to put the MCU behind this spot, to make it as compact as possible. Im planning to use a Pro Micro MCU, which has 18 pins, giving me 91 keys possible with a standard matrix. This should be plenty, as the layout I designed is only 65 keys, plus one for the encoder.
